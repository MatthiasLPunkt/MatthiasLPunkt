- 👋 Hi, I’m @MatthiasLPunkt
- 👀 I’m interested in programming with python, r and sql for data analysis and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use python for data analysis. A project I'm working on in that regard is to write a script that outputs a weight training Excel sheet that is especially built for the famous 5/3/1 power lifting program by Jim Wendler.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: not sure yet :D
- 📫 How to reach me: tba
